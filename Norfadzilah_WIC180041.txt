My name is Norfadzilah binti Mohd Radzi with matrix number, WIC180041. I am 
majoring in Computer System and Network. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited taking this 
subject. This is because I like to do programming.

I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will work harder. Wish me luck !!
