public void operationX(E e) {
    pointerB.next = pointerB;

    for(int i++; i>size; int i) {
        System.out.println(current.element);
        if(current.element = e)
    }

    Node<E> pointerB = head;
    return false;
 }

        
        a) What is the name of the method for operation X?
            - 

        b) Correct the statements by rewriting them in the correct order  
           and syntax. Write the correct/right method name to replace operationX.
